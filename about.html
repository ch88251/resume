        <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Charles Hayes, a passionate individual hailing from the sunny
          shores of Florida but currently calling the breathtaking landscapes
          of Colorado my home. Ever since I moved to Colorado at the age of 12,
          I've been captivated by the majestic mountains, the crisp air, and the
          vibrant community that surrounds me.</p>

        <p>Life has a funny way of steering us in unexpected directions, and my
          journey is a testament to that. After graduating from Douglas County High
          School in Castle Rock, Colorado, my initial plan was to pursue a career
          in architecture. I was drawn to the artistry and precision required to
          bring structures to life. However, fate had something else in store for
          me.</p>

        <p>In a twist of fate, I made the decision to enlist in the U.S. Army.
          This choice allowed me to discover a new sense of purpose and instilled
          in me a profound sense of discipline, resilience, and a commitment to serve
          something greater than myself. During my time in the Army, I faced challenges
          head-on and developed valuable skills that have shaped me into the person I
          am today.</p>

        <p>Beyond my military service, I have cultivated a wide range of interests
          and skills that continue to shape my personal and professional endeavors.
          Whether it's exploring the great outdoors, engaging in intellectual conversations,
          or immersing myself in the world of technology, I am fueled by a relentless
          curiosity and a hunger for knowledge.</p>
